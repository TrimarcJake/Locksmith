    .SYNOPSIS
        Check if the installed version of the Locksmith module is up to date.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script checks the installed version of the Locksmith module against the latest release on GitHub.
        It determines if the installed version is considered "out of date" based on the number of days specified.
        If the installed version is out of date, a warning message is displayed along with information about the latest release.

    .PARAMETER Version
        Specifies the version number to check from the script.

    .PARAMETER Days
        Specifies the number of days past a module release date at which to consider the release "out of date".
        The default value is 60 days.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.Boolean
        Returns $true if the installed version is up to date, and $false if it is out of date.

    .EXAMPLE
        Test-IsRecentVersion -Version "2024.1" -Days 30
        True

        Test-IsRecentVersion -Version "2023.10" -Days 60
        WARNING: Your currently installed version of Locksmith (2.5) is more than 60 days old. We recommend that you update to ensure the latest findings are included.
