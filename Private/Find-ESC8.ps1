    .SYNOPSIS
        Finds ADCS objects with enrollment endpoints and identifies the enrollment type.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script takes an array of ADCS objects and filters them based on the presence of a CA enrollment endpoint.
        It then determines the enrollment type (HTTP or HTTPS) for each object and returns the results.

    .PARAMETER ADCSObjects
        Specifies the array of ADCS objects to process. This parameter is mandatory.

    .OUTPUTS
        An object representing the ADCS object with the following properties:
        - Forest: The forest name of the object.
        - Name: The name of the object.
        - DistinguishedName: The distinguished name of the object.
        - CAEnrollmentEndpoint: The CA enrollment endpoint of the object.
        - Issue: The identified issue with the enrollment type.
        - Fix: The recommended fix for the issue.
        - Revert: The recommended revert action for the issue.
        - Technique: The technique used to identify the issue.

    .EXAMPLE
        $ADCSObjects = Get-ADCSObjects
        $Results = $ADCSObjects | Find-ESC8
        $Results

An HTTP enrollment endpoint is available. It is possible to relay NTLM
authentication to this HTTP endpoint.

If the LAN Manager authentication level of any domain in this forest is 2 or
less, an attacker can coerce authentication from a Domain Controller (DC) and
relay it to this HTTP enrollment enpoint to receive a certificate which can be
used to authenticate as that DC.

'@
                    Fix                  = @'
Disable HTTP access and enforce HTTPS.
Enable EPA.
Disable NTLM authentication (if possible.)

                }
                if ($endpoint.URL -match '^https:') {
                    $Issue.Issue = @'
An HTTPS enrollment endpoint is available. It may be possible to relay NTLM
authentication to this HTTPS endpoint. Enabling IIS Extended Protection for
Authentication or disabling NTLM authentication completely, NTLM relay is not
possible.

If those protection are not in place, and the LAN Manager authentication level
of any domain in this forest is 2 or less, an attacker can coerce authentication
from a Domain Controller (DC) and relay it to this HTTPS enrollment enpoint to
receive a certificate which can be used to authenticate as that DC.

'@
                    $Issue.Fix = @'
Ensure EPA is enabled.
Disable NTLM authentication (if possible.)
