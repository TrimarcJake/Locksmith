## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Locksmith Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmithblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmithissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Platform, and Version of Client Machine. (Locksmith is only supported on Windows 10+/2016+ at this time.)
  - Single or multi-domain Forest?
  - Powershell version (ISE/Windows Powershell/Powershell Core)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue?
